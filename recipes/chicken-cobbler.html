            <li>Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the mix, and milk in a bowl until well blended; pour over the chicken and veggies. Spread lightly and evenly over the top of the  mixture but do not stir.  </li>
            <li>Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.  </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden brown and only very slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
